    "\n",
    "You are given a string `keysPressed` of length `n`, where `keysPressed[i]` was the `ith` key pressed in the testing sequence, and a sorted list `releaseTimes`, where `releaseTimes[i]` was the time the `ith` key was released. Both arrays are 0-indexed. The `0th` key was pressed at the time `0`, and every subsequent key was pressed at the exact time the previous key was released.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tester wants to know the key of the keypress that had the longest duration. The `ith`keypress had a duration of `releaseTimes[i] - releaseTimes[i - 1]`, and the `0th` keypress had a duration of `releaseTimes[0]`.\n",
