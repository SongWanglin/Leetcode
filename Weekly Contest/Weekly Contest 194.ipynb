    "\n",
    "Given an array of strings names of size n. You will create n folders in your file system such that, at the ith minute, you will create a folder with the name names[i].\n",
    "\n",
    "Since two files cannot have the same name, if you enter a folder name which is previously used, the system will have a suffix addition to its name in the form of (k), where, k is the smallest positive integer such that the obtained name remains unique.\n",

    "Input: names = [\"pes\",\"fifa\",\"gta\",\"pes(2019)\"]\n",

    "Explanation: Let's see how the file system creates folder names:\n",
    "\"pes\" --> not assigned before, remains \"pes\"\n",
    "\"fifa\" --> not assigned before, remains \"fifa\"\n",
    "\"gta\" --> not assigned before, remains \"gta\"\n",

    "\"gta\" --> not assigned before, remains \"gta\"\n",
    "\"gta(1)\" --> not assigned before, remains \"gta(1)\"\n",
    "\"gta\" --> the name is reserved, system adds (k), since \"gta(1)\" is also reserved, systems put k = 2. it becomes \"gta(2)\"\n",

A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the edges of the graph that connects all vertices without cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.\n",

An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to increase is called a critical edge.
