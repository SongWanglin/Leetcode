    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array of positive integers `arr`,  find a pattern of length `m` that is repeated `k` or more times.\n",
    "\n",
    "A pattern is a subarray (consecutive sub-sequence) that consists of one or more values, repeated multiple times consecutively without overlapping. A pattern is defined by its length and the number of repetitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return `true` *if there exists a pattern of length* `m` *that is repeated* `k` *or more times, otherwise return* `false`.\n",
