**445. Add Two Numbers II**

You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Follow up:**What if you cannot modify the input lists? In other words, reversing the lists is not allowed.

**Example:**

**Input:** (7 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 3) + (5 -&gt; 6 -&gt; 4)

**Output:** 7 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 0 -&gt; 7
