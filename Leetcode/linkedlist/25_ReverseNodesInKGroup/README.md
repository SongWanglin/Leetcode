**25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group**

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list _k_ at a time and return its modified list.

_k_ is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of _k_ then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.

**Example:**

Given this linked list: 1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5

For _k_ = 2, you should return: 2-&gt;1-&gt;4-&gt;3-&gt;5

For _k_ = 3, you should return: 3-&gt;2-&gt;1-&gt;4-&gt;5

**Note:**

- Only constant extra memory is allowed.
- You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.
