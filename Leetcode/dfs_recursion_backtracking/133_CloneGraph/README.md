**133. Clone Graph**

Given a reference of a node in a [**connected**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)#Connected_graph) undirected graph, return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

 

**Example:**

**Input:**

{"$id":"1","neighbors":[{"$id":"2","neighbors":[{"$ref":"1"},{"$id":"3","neighbors":[{"$ref":"2"},{"$id":"4","neighbors":[{"$ref":"3"},{"$ref":"1"}],"val":4}],"val":3}],"val":2},{"$ref":"4"}],"val":1}

**Explanation:**

Node 1's value is 1, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.

Node 2's value is 2, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.

Node 3's value is 3, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.

Node 4's value is 4, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.

 

**Note:**

1. The number of nodes will be between 1 and 100.
2. The undirected graph is a [simple graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#Simple_graph), which means no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
3. Since the graph is undirected, if node _p_ has node _q_ as neighbor, then node _q_ must have node _p_ as neighbor too.
4. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.
