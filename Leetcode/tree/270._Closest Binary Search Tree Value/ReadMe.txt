270. Closest Binary Search Tree Value
Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find the value in the BST that is closest to the target.

Example
Given root = {1}, target = 4.428571, return 1.

Notice
Given target value is a floating point.
You are guaranteed to have only one unique value in the BST that is closest to the target.
